# Sprint Simulation

Currently I've gotten into a lot of discussion over the question *"In scrum should we pre-assign tasks during sprint planning?"*. 

I'm absolutely for pre-assigning tasks, because:

- It's easier to address individual capacities (e.g. the never-before-heard "part-time")
- It's fairer ("You do this ugly bug, and I'll do that one.")
- It's more efficient (just give the task to whoever estimates the fastest time)
- It makes the planning faster (everybody has to understand only their own tasks, and team members can even prepare for that)
- Many bugs are already implicitly preassigned, because team members are expert in different things
- You don't double book people (e.g. by adding two tasks that can only be done by one person efficiently, when each of them alone would fill the time of that person completely)

My team is against it, because:

1. It's not failsafe (if a member can't participate in the sprint, nobody can take on their tasks)

(I don't think there was ever a second argument.)

And just to address this:

1. "Nobody can take on their tasks" - this is exactly what happens in our team. And we don't pre-assign. It's just that implicitly assigned tasks will not be done by anybody else. For good reason. If the expert is back next sprint, why should I half-ass their tasks?

I have another suspicion why pre-assigning tasks is better, and that is our horrible estimations. It's clear that you never learn to estimate if you can't practice, so in that regard pre-assignments are already better. However I have a hunch that even with good estimations it won't work if multiple people estimate, and only one of those does the task.

*This project was born to simulate sprint planning and execution, and figure out if you can estimate tasks as a group.*
